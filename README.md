## Documentation

My graduation project was to create a new design- and component library for Glamorous Goat. This way they can make CMS pages faster and more consistent. The components in this project are all custom made React JS components. I chose to use PropTypes over TypeScript because they were not using any typing at all. PropTypes is more forgiving therefore I think their developers will have an easier time adjusting to this way of coding.

Below is the documentation I made for their developers so that they have an easy start with the library.
